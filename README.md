# Teacher-student_scheme
This tutorial introduces a teacher-student scheme to systematically compare different QNN architectures and to evaluate their relative expressive power. This scheme avoids training to a specific dataset and compares the learning capacity of different quantum models.

It is based on the paper " Exploring Quantum Perceptrons and Quantum Neural Networks with a teacher-student scheme" by [Aikaterini Gratsea and Patrick Huembeli](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.01477).
